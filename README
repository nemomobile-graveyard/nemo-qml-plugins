this is a repository for shared C++-only QML plugins, offering access to
subsystems inside the platform like image thumbnailing.

if you want to add something, please ask the maintainer of this library first to
make sure it's a good fit

the current maintainer is: Robin Burchell (robin+mer@viroteck.net)

current plugins:
 - thumbnailer: offers an image provider for fast thumbnailing/sharing of
   thumbnail cache between multiple applications

   to use, access image://nemoThumbnail/path/to/file.jpg in an Image element.

- contacts: offers an API similar to QtMobility.contacts, except without the
  fail

- qrencode: QR encoder API, using qrencode library.

- folderlistmodel: threaded (and faster) version of Qt.labs.folderlistmodel

- configuration: offers ConfigurationValue, a QML object interacting with dconf.

- email: offers a QML-friendly email API using Qt Messaging Framework as a backend.
