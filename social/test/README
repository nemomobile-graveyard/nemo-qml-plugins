This test is a manual test, as automated testing would require an
account on Facebook with a known number of albums/photos/comments
etc, and credentials would need to be included in the code, which
of course is against the Terms Of Service.

Thus, the test is actually an application which should be run when
any code is changed, to ensure correct working.

It consists of:
1) Notifications View
2) Albums View
3) Per-Album Photos View
4) Per-Photo Comments View

The test should be invoked from the command line, with an access token
passed as the only parameter.

e.g.:

./socialtest ABCDEF123456

Note that the test uses the SailFish.Silica component set.
